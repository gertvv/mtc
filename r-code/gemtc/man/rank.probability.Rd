\title{Calculating rank-probabilities}
\description{
Rank probability ranks the treatments by binning the samples based upon the their relative effect. 
The result of the ranking is divided by the total amount of samples, making he columns and rows of the resulting matrix sum to 1.
}
\usage{
rank.probability(result)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{result}{Object of S3 class \code{mtc.result} to be used in creation of the rank probability table}
}
\value{A matrix with the treatments as rows and the ranks as columns}
